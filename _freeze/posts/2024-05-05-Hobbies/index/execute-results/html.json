I love doing anything from hot weighted power vinyassas to slower bikram yogas. Wherever I am, I enjoy trying new studios, meeting new people, and testing out new poses. Getting my yoga teacher training certification has always been a goal of mine that I hope to find time to accomplish soon.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rollerskate.jpg){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne of my most recent hobbies has been roller skating! I bought a cheap pair of roller skates from a thrift store and have been teaching myself how to skate. I played ice hockey for most of my life, so I have found some of that experience helpful, however, it has still been quiet a challenge!\n",
