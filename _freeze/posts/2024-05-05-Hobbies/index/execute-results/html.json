My family is my biggest support system. I have one older brother, who recently moved to San Francisco and so I take every opportunity I can to visit. My parents both still live on Aquidneck Island, but love visiting us out west as they both met in SF and still have many friends there. My friends, all of which I have known since birth, live within a mile radius of me and we try to spend every possible moment together. Whether that be swimming in the ocean in the summer or sledding down hills in the winter, we are always doing something.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](yoga.JPG)\n:::\n:::\n\nSince COVID in 2020, I have been addicted to yoga. I love doing anything from hot weighted power vinyassas to slower bikram yogas. Wherever I am, I enjoy trying new studios, meeting new people, and testing out new poses. Getting my yoga teacher training certification has always been a goal of mine that I hope to find time to accomplish soon.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](rollerskate.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne of my most recent hobbies has been roller skating! I bought a cheap pair of roller skates from a thrift store and have been teaching myself how to skate. I played ice hockey for most of my life, so I have found some of that experience helpful, however, it has still been quiet a challenge!\n",
