**Welcome!**

Nice to meet you! Let's start with a little bit about me. I am Ella Stookey, a third year Environmental Studies (B.S.) student at UC Santa Barbara. My studies focus on the roots of our current environmental challenges and exploring potential solutions. The knowledge I've gained pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree and through my early work experience, combined with my teamwork skills and work ethic would allow me to make a measurable and positive impact.
