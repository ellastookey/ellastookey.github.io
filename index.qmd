### Welcome!

Nice to meet you! Let's start with a little bit about me. I am Ella Stookey, a third year Environmental Studies (B.S.) student at UC Santa Barbara. I have lived my whole life on Aquidneck Island in Rhode Island, an island with a population of around 60,000 and made up of three towns. Although I loved growing up here, I decided for college I wanted a new experience with new types of people, leading me to UCSB.
