#### Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending my free time with friends and family, doing yoga, trying new things, and being outside as much as possible!

Since COVID in 2020, I have been addicted to yoga. I love doing anything from hot weighted power vinyasas to slower bikram yogas. Wherever I am, I enjoy trying new studios, meeting new people, and testing out new poses. Getting my yoga teacher training certification has always been a goal of mine that I hope to find time to accomplish soon.

When possible, I try to spend as much time as I can in and around the ocean. I love going for swims, cold plunges, tubing, and sailing. When I was younger, one of my favorite traditions was the January 1st cold plunge, an event where the whole town meets on the beach and runs into the freezing water. I am so lucky I got to move to another spot by the ocean for UCSB. Very grateful!

One of my most recent hobbies has been roller skating! I bought a cheap pair of roller skates from a thrift store and have been teaching myself how to skate. I played ice hockey for most of my life, so I have found some of that experience helpful, however, it has still been quiet a challenge!
